# What is Amazon VPC?


With Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), you can launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual 
		network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network 
		that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable 
		infrastructure of AWS.


The following diagram shows an example VPC. The VPC has one subnet in each of the 
		Availability Zones in the Region, EC2 instances in each subnet, and an internet gateway
		to allow communication between the resources in your VPC and the internet.


For more information, see Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).


## Features


The following features help you configure a VPC to provide the connectivity
			that your applications need:


A VPC is a virtual 
					network that closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate
					in your own data center. After you create a VPC, you can add subnets.


A subnet is a range of 
					IP addresses in your VPC. A subnet must reside in a single Availability Zone.
					After you add subnets, you can deploy AWS resources in your VPC.


You can assign IP addresses, 
					both IPv4 and IPv6, to your VPCs and subnets. You can also bring your public 
					IPv4 addresses and IPv6 GUA addresses to AWS and allocate them to resources in your VPC, 
					such as EC2 instances, NAT gateways, and Network Load Balancers.


Use route tables to determine 
					where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed.


A gateway connects your VPC to 
					another network. For example, use an internet gateway
					to connect your VPC to the internet. Use a VPC endpoint to connect to AWS services privately, without 
					the use of an internet gateway or NAT device.


Use a VPC peering connection 
					to route traffic between the resources in two VPCs.


Copy network traffic from 
					network interfaces and send it to security and monitoring appliances for 
					deep packet inspection.


Use a transit gateway, which 
					acts as a central hub, to route traffic between your VPCs, VPN connections,
				    and Direct Connect connections.


A flow log captures information 
					about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC.


Connect your VPCs to your on-premises networks using
					AWS Virtual Private Network (Site-to-Site VPN).


## Getting started with Amazon VPC


Your AWS account includes a default VPC in each AWS Region. 
			Your default VPCs are configured such that you can immediately start launching and connecting 
			to EC2 instances. For more information, see Plan your VPC.


You can choose to create additional VPCs with the subnets, IP addresses, gateways
			and routing that you need. For more information, see Create a VPC.


## Working with Amazon VPC


You can create and manage your VPCs using any of the following interfaces:

- AWS Management Console â Provides a web interface that you can
                    use to access your VPCs.
- AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) â
					Provides commands for a broad set of AWS services, including Amazon VPC, and is
					supported on Windows, Mac, and Linux. For more information, see AWS Command Line Interface.
- AWS SDKs â Provides language-specific
					APIs and takes care of many of the connection details, such as calculating
					signatures, handling request retries, and error handling. For more information,
					see AWS SDKs.
- Query API â Provides low-level API actions 
                    that you call using HTTPS requests. Using the Query API is the most direct way to
                    access Amazon VPC, but it requires that your application handle low-level details such as
                    generating the hash to sign the request, and error handling. For more information, 
                    see Amazon VPC actions in 
					the Amazon EC2 API Reference.


## Pricing for Amazon VPC


There's no additional charge for using a VPC. There are, however, charges for some VPC
			components, such as NAT gateways, IP Address Manager, traffic mirroring, Reachability Analyzer, and
			Network Access Analyzer. For more information, see Amazon VPC Pricing.


Nearly all resources that you launch in your virtual private cloud (VPC) provide you
			with an IP address for connectivity. The vast majority of resources in your VPC use
			private IPv4 addresses. Resources that require direct access to the internet over IPv4,
			however, use public IPv4 addresses.


Amazon VPC enables you to launch managed services, such as Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon RDS, and Amazon EMR, without having a VPC set up beforehand. It does this by using the default
				VPC in your account if you have
				one. Any public IPv4 addresses provisioned to your account by the managed
			service will be charged. These charges will be associated with Amazon VPC service in
			your AWS Cost and Usage Report.


Pricing for public IPv4 addresses


A public IPv4 address is an IPv4 address that is
			routable from the internet. A public IPv4 address is necessary for a resource to be
			directly reachable from the internet over IPv4.


If you are an existing or new AWS Free Tier
			customer, you get 750 hours of public IPv4 address usage with the EC2 service at no
			charge. If you are not using the EC2 service in the AWS Free Tier, Public IPv4
			addresses are charged. For specific pricing information, see the Public IPv4 address tab in Amazon VPC Pricing.


Private IPv4 addresses (RFC
				1918) are not charged. For more information about how public IPv4 addresses
			are charged for shared VPCs, see Billing and
				metering for the owner and participants.


Public IPv4 addresses have the following types:

- Elastic IP addresses (EIPs): Static, public IPv4 addresses
                provided by Amazon that you can associate with an EC2 instance, elastic network
                interface, or AWS resource.
- EC2 public IPv4 addresses: Public IPv4 addresses assigned to
                an EC2 instance by Amazon (if the EC2 instance is launched into a default subnet or
                if the instance is launched into a subnet thatâs been configured to automatically
                assign a public IPv4 address).
- BYOIPv4 addresses: Public IPv4 addresses in the IPv4 address
                range that youâve brought to AWS using Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP).
- Service-managed IPv4 addresses: Public IPv4 addresses
                automatically provisioned on AWS resources and managed by an AWS service. For
                example, public IPv4 addresses on Amazon ECS, Amazon RDS, or Amazon WorkSpaces.


The following list shows the most common AWS services that can use public IPv4
			addresses.

- Amazon WorkSpaces Applications
- AWS Client VPN
- AWS Database Migration Service
- Amazon EC2
- Amazon Elastic Container Service
- Amazon EKS
- Amazon EMR

- AWS Global Accelerator
- AWS Mainframe Modernization
- Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka
- Amazon MQ
- Amazon RDS
- Amazon Redshift
- AWS Site-to-Site VPN
- Amazon VPC NAT gateway
- Amazon WorkSpaces
- Elastic Load Balancing
